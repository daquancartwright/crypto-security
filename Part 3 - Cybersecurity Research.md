Target 2013 Breach

Overview:
    In 2013 suffered a significant data breach that affected over 40 million customers. The breach occurred during the holiday shopping season, from November 27 to December 15, and exposed sensitive customer information, including credit card data, names, addresses, and phone numbers. The breach had a profound impact on Target's reputation, resulting in substantial financial losses and damaging customer trust.


Tech Flaws, How were hackers able to breach their system:
     The initial point of entry into Target's network was traced back to a third-party vendor who had access to Target's systems. The attackers exploited this weak point by stealing login credentials from the vendor, most likely through a phishing attack or by compromising their systems.

     Once inside the network, the hackers moved laterally, leveraging the weaknesses in Target's network architecture to gain access to the point-of-sale (POS) systems. They installed malware on these systems, specifically targeting the POS terminals that process credit card transactions. The malware, known as RAM scraping malware, captured unencrypted credit card data as it passed through the memory of the infected systems.


What has Target Done:
    Following the breach, Target implemented a series of measures to address the vulnerabilities that had been exploited. The company made significant investments in enhancing its cybersecurity defenses and implementing more robust security protocols. Some of the actions taken by Target include:
